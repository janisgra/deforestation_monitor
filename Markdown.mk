#Detecting Illegal Deforestation via Satellite Imagery

##About the Project

Our hackathon project, "Detecting Illegal Deforestation via Satellite Imagery," aims to address a pressing global issue: the illegal deforestation that threatens biodiversity, contributes to climate change, and disrupts local communities. By leveraging the power of satellite imagery and machine learning, our solution simplifies supply chain management and enhances control questionnaires, ensuring that companies can monitor and maintain sustainable practices.

##Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from the increasing awareness of environmental sustainability and the urgent need to combat illegal deforestation. With many companies committing to zero-deforestation policies, the challenge lies in effectively monitoring vast forest areas and ensuring compliance. Traditional methods are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. We envisioned a tech-driven solution that could provide accurate, real-time data to help companies uphold their environmental commitments and foster transparency in their supply chains.
What We Learned

##Throughout the project, we delved deep into various domains, including remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental science. We learned about the complexities of satellite imagery, the nuances of different types of forests, and the subtle indicators of deforestation activities. Our team gained valuable insights into:

*Satellite Data Analysis: Understanding how to process and interpret satellite imagery from different sources such as Landsat and Sentinel.
*Machine Learning Models: Training and optimizing models to detect deforestation patterns with high accuracy.
*Environmental Impact: Recognizing the broader implications of deforestation on ecosystems and climate change.

##How We Built the Project

Our project was built in several stages:
*Data Collection: We sourced satellite imagery from open-access platforms like NASA's Landsat and ESA's Sentinel. We focused on regions known for illegal deforestation activities.
*Data Preprocessing: This involved cleaning the data, removing clouds, and normalizing the images to ensure consistency.
*Model Training: We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect deforestation patterns. We trained our models using labeled datasets of deforested and non-deforested areas.
*Integration: We developed an intuitive dashboard that visualizes deforestation activities, enabling users to track changes over time and generate reports for supply chain management.
*Validation: We tested our model's accuracy by comparing its predictions with known deforestation events and refining it based on feedback.

##Challenges Faced

Our journey was not without its challenges. Some of the significant hurdles included:

*Data Quality: Satellite imagery can be affected by weather conditions, cloud cover, and resolution limitations, making it difficult to obtain clear and consistent data.
*Model Accuracy: Training a model that accurately distinguishes between natural forest changes and illegal deforestation required extensive experimentation and fine-tuning.
*Resource Constraints: Processing large volumes of satellite data is computationally intensive, and we had to optimize our algorithms to work within the available resources.
*Interdisciplinary Knowledge: Combining expertise from remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental science was crucial, and we had to bridge knowledge gaps within our team.

Despite these challenges, our project successfully demonstrated the potential of technology in combating illegal deforestation. By providing an efficient and scalable solution, we hope to empower companies and organizations to take proactive steps in preserving our planet's forests.

We are excited about the future possibilities of our project and look forward to further refining and expanding its capabilities. Our journey at the hackathon has been a tremendous learning experience, and we are committed to contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible world.
